<h2>FestivOne</h2>
<ul>
<li>FestiveOne is a desktop-based event management application that streamlines event planning and coordination for both customers and event organizers. </li>
<li>Primary objective for this project was to develop a user-friendly platform that enables customers to book event tickets with ease. To accomplish this, we utilized JavaFX for graphical user interface components and Scene Builder for FXML layout design. </li>
<li>Additionally, we leveraged the Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) protocol to establish a seamless connection between the web application and the MySQL database, facilitating the storage, retrieval, and dynamic updating of event-related information.</li>
<li>The frontend of the application was created using JavaFX, resulting in a highly responsive and visually appealing interface for users. With the aid of Scene Builder, a drag-and-drop design tool, FXML files were seamlessly integrated with the Java database.</li>
<li>Key features of our application include authentication, event creation and modification and registration, and data management.</li>
<li>The project not only showcases the practical implementation of JavaFX and JDBC but also the implementation of a well-structured database. FestiveOne offers a seamless experience for users in booking event tickets and managing events, emphasizing synergy between the frontend and backend.</li>
